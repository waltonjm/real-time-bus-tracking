# Real Time Bus Tracking
## Description
MIT xProÂ® Professional Certificate in Coding Boot Camp Project: Real Time Bus Tracker. This repo is a boot camp oot camp project which shows the bus stops located between the MIT campus and Harvard University campus located in Boston, MA.

## Installation
You will need to go to mapbox.com and set up an account to grab a mapboxgl: JavaScript (JS) Library that is part of the mapbox ecosystem. Clone the index.html, pacmen.js, and all the image files into your GitHub repo. Fork into your repository. Open your source code editor of choice, insert your API access key and copy the code and save it to your local machine. Then create an about:blank page in your browser of choice and move the index.html file into the search bar. 

## Usage
This project demonstrated how to work with the document Object Model (DOM) to add animation to maps. Go to mapbox.com to obtain a free Application Programming Interface (API) key to test out mapbox. Mapbox is an open-source platform which allows developers to create and display (a limited number of times) maps on a web page. Using the mapboxgl JS libary, developers can add customizations to their maps such as markers as in the case of this boot camp project.

## Support
Go to: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/ for documentation. Go to: https://new.mta.info/developers for more developer resources including new, public APIs. Google: Longitude, Latitudes (Note mapboxg1 standard is lng, lat)

## Roadmap
This project was completed within the first 4 weeks of the intensive boot camp as is required to be presented as a part of student boot camp portfolio. It is anticipated, and provided time is available, that this project will be improved upon as skill sets progress through the boot camp.
